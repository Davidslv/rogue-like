# Game Design: Article 05: Simple Gameplay

By Mark Damon Hughes <kamikaze@kuoi.asui.uidaho.edu>

I think a large, and not well-recognized, part of why Doom and Quake and Descent did so well is not because they have 3D texture mapping with moody lighting and soundtracks by Trent Reznor, but because they're simple and well-focused games, on the same order as the classic arcade games.

The real opportunity here is that all three of those have the exact same gameplay - hunt your friends and/or computer monsters with big guns in a maze and pick up powerups. I'm reasonably sure there are other games possible, with or without that technology.
