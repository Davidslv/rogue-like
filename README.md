# A Roguelike

This is my pet project where I intend to accomplish two goals:

- Learn C/C++
- Learn about Game Development

Of course this will be highly based on the original game, [Rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game).
I've read parts of its [source code](https://github.com/davidslv/rogue) and if I manage to be skilled enough I want to port it
to C++, this is my attempt on understanding the game, C language and develop my C++ knowledge.

Hopefully I will manage to have it in a playable state, but no promisses.
