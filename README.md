# A Roguelike

This is my pet project where I intend to accomplish two goals:

- Learn C/C++
- Learn about Game Development

Of course this will be highly based on the original game, [Rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)).

I've read parts of its [source code](https://github.com/davidslv/rogue) and if I manage to be skilled enough I want to port it
to C++, this is my attempt on understanding the game, C language and develop my C++ knowledge.

Hopefully I will manage to have it in a playable state, but no promisses.


# How to run the game?

```
  make play
```

# Which gcc version are you using?

I'm using gcc 4.2.1

```
$ gcc --version
Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1
Apple LLVM version 8.0.0 (clang-800.0.38)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0
```
